            <br />
            <p>
            Hi, I'm Aina, a 26-year-old Frontend Engineer 
            based in Berlin, Germany.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> 
            I'm a Front End Engineer interested in creative coding, 
            security, and sustainable engineering. 
            I work at Kr√∂pelin Projekt GmbH.
            </p>

            <p>
            I'm focused on building products with JavaScript, specifically, React and React-Native. 
            
            </p>
            <p>I also have Full Stack experience with PHP and open-source CMS like WordPress, Drupal, and ILIAS.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm likely searching for new restaurants, learning Chinese, or contributing to the queer and FLINTA scene of Berlin.
            </p>
            <br />
